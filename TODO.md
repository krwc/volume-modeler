# High priority:
* Fix transition glitches somehow.
* Finish implementation of proper GUI for scene loading and saving.

# Medium priority:
* Make some kind of texture-materials for brushes.
* Implement some lighting maybe.
* Optimize harder - maybe there is something that can be done to speed-up
  chunk rendering even further without sacrifacing quality?

# Almost medium priority:
* It would be great to have better brush tools.
