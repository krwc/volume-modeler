# Voxeland #

Voxeland is an early stage work-in-progress voxel engine written in C++
that exploits OpenCL for fast surface extraction.

It aims to be as nicely looking and featured as Voxelfarm, but **for free**.

# Features #
* Smooth and sharp surfaces due to being based on Dual Contouring algorithm.
